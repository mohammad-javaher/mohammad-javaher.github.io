## 🎯 A self-taught AI enthusiast passionate about building intelligent systems to solve real-world problems in:
- 🤖 **Machine Learning** & **Deep Learning**  
- 📈 **Data Analysis** using real, uncleaned datasets
- 🌿 **AgriTech** & Smart Greenhouse Management  

I'm passionate about technology, especially in the fields of Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and intelligent systems. I’m interested in how these technologies can be applied to solve real-world problems across different industries — including agriculture, automation, and IoT.

I enjoy exploring how data and AI can create smarter, more efficient systems. My goal is to contribute to meaningful, innovative projects with practical impact.

🔹 Always open to learning, collaborating, and building forward-thinking solutions.
