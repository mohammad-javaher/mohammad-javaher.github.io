# Building Linear Regression from Scratch

I recently built a **Linear Regression model from scratch** to better understand how machine learning works under the hood. Instead of using scikit-learn or other ML libraries, I implemented everything step by step in Python with NumPy.

The notebook covers:

- Defining weight and bias
    
- Making predictions
    
- Using **Mean Squared Error** as the loss function
    
- Updating parameters with **gradient descent**
    
- Training, evaluating, and visualizing results
    

This project helped me to see how learning rates affect convergence, and the importance of vectorized operations for speed.

The model successfully learns simple linear patterns, and the loss curve shows clear convergence.
